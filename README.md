*DESCRIPTION*:This project is a fully functional Movie Search Application built using React.js, created as part of a frontend development task focused on API integration, state management, and UI structuring. The main goal of the assignment was to develop an app that allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and save selected movies to a personal favorites list. The application relies on a public API (OMDb API) to fetch movie details such as title, poster, release year, genre, ratings, and plot descriptions.

The app offers a smooth search experience where users can type the name of a movie and instantly get results fetched from the API. Once a movie is selected, the application displays detailed information in a clean and visually appealing card format. Users also have the ability to save their favorite movies, which are stored locally using localStorage, ensuring that the favorites list remains intact even after the page is refreshed. This feature adds personalization and enhances user engagement.

I built the project using React.js to take advantage of its component-based structure, fast rendering using the Virtual DOM, and declarative approach to UI building. Key React concepts such as useState and useEffect were used to handle search queries, API calls, and favorite movie storage. The app is organized into separate reusable components, such as SearchBar, MovieList, MovieCard, and FavoritesList, making the code more maintainable and easier to scale.

To ensure a visually clean and attractive layout, I used custom CSS (or Tailwind, if you choose to include it) to style the application. The UI is designed to be minimal, easy to navigate, and responsive across different screen sizes. A responsive design ensures that users can access the app comfortably from devices like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. I intentionally kept the UI simple while maintaining clarity, allowing users to quickly find movies and save favorites without distractions.

The development environment for this project was Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which offered powerful extensions for debugging, linting, formatting, and React-specific enhancements. Git and GitHub were used for version control, allowing smooth project tracking, managing commits, and preparing the project for deployment. Uploading the project to GitHub makes the code accessible, organized, and ready for hosting through services such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

This assignment helped reinforce real-world skills like API integration, dynamic searching, conditional rendering, and local storage management. I also gained practical experience in designing a UI that feels intuitive and modern. Working on features like Favorites required me to think about data persistence, user experience, and component communication — all essential parts of frontend development.

Overall, the Movie Search App demonstrates my ability to build a scalable, interactive React application from scratch, featuring real-time data fetching, clean UI design, and user personalization. The project reflects my hands-on understanding of React fundamentals, API handling, state management, and responsive front-end development. It also shows my capability to create functional, user-friendly web applications that are ready to deploy and use in a real-world environment.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
